# [](#header-1)🔠 Text and Layer Effects

In this step, we will insert text into the photo and add some layer effects to the text. First, it is simple to add normal text into a picture. But, before inserting actual text, let’s try to learn how to group layers. It makes it much easier to control a text layer independently. 

### [](#header-3)Group layers

With no layers selected, click the ‘Create a new group’ on the right bottom.

As a result, you can see the new group called ‘Group 1’ and if you double click the name of the group, you can change the name of the group. Let’s change the name to whatever you want and press Enter. I named it “Text.”

### [](#header-3)Insert Text

Now, let’s insert normal text into the photo. Click the ‘Horizontal Type Tool’ () and click wherever you want to insert the text in the picture and you can edit the text when you click the text. “Lorem Ipsum” could be displayed as a default text. Let’s change it to “The.” Then, drag and drop the text layer into the group named Text.
