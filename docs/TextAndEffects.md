# [](#header-1)🔠 Text and Layer Effects

In this step, we will insert text into the photo and add some layer effects to the text. First, it is simple to add normal text into a picture. But, before inserting actual text, let’s try to learn how to group layers. It makes it much easier to control a text layer independently. 

## [](#header-2)Group layers

With no layers selected, click the ‘Create a new group’ ( <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Create a new group.png" alt="Create a new group" width="20" height="20"> ) on the right bottom.

As a result, you can see the new group called ‘Group 1’ and if you double click the name of the group, you can change the name of the group. Let’s change the name to whatever you want and press Enter. I named it “Text.”

## [](#header-2)Insert Text

Now, let’s insert normal text into the photo. Click the ‘Horizontal Type Tool’ () and click wherever you want to insert the text in the picture and you can edit the text when you click the text. “Lorem Ipsum” could be displayed as a default text. Let’s change it to “The.” Then, drag and drop the text layer into the group named Text.

Let's create the text "Last" and "Samurai" in the same way. By the way, Please select the font size and style according to your preference.

Now let's change the position of the text. You can easily reposition by clicking the “Move tool” ( <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Move tool.png" alt="Move Tool" width="25" height="20"> ) and dragging and dropping. Don’t forget clicking “Move tool” to drag the text layers.

Well done! Now, it’s time to add a layer style to the text layers.

## [](#header-2)Add a layer style

First, make one copy of each text layer. Select the text layer, right-click and click "Duplicate Layer." When the Duplicate Layer pop up window appears, click OK.
(This is for the shiny-silver-effect we are aiming for. Therefore, it may be an unnecessary step when decorating the text with a different style.)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer1.png" alt="Layer1" width="670" height="800">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer1-2.png" alt="Layer1-2" width="670" height="300">

So, you will see the six text layers, “Samurai”, “Samurai copy”, “Last”, “Last copy”, “The”
, and “The copy.”

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer1-3.png" alt="Layer1-3" width="400" height="600">

Now, let’s start with adding a layer style to the “The” layer. With the “The copy” text layer (not “The”) selected, click the “Add a layer style” ( <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Add a style.png" alt="Add a style" width="20" height="20"> ) button and click “Blending option.” Or you can double click the “The” text layer to do the same thing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer2.png" alt="Layer2" width="670" height="800"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer2-2.png" alt="Layer2-2" width="270" height="600">

When the Layer Style window pops up, please click or set the following in order. “Gradient Overlay” - “Opacity: 100%” - “Gradient: Black, White” - “Gradient: Reverse” - “Style: Reflected” - “Angle: 90 degree” - “Scale: 150%”

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer3.png" alt="Layer3" width="600" height="450">

Then move to “Bevel & Emboss” tab, “Style: Inner Bevel” - “Technique: Chisel Hard” - “Depth: 170%” - “Direction: Up” - “Size: 10px” - “Angle: 120 degree” - “Check ‘Use Global Light’” - “Altitude: 30 degree” - “Gloss Contour: Ring Double” - “Highlight Mode: Screen and choose white as a color, Opacity: 50%” - “Shadow Mode: Multiply, and choose black as a color, Opacity: 50%” then, click OK.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer5.png" alt="Layer5" width="600" height="450">

Boom! As you can see, the text “The” has a silver metal effect! But to make this look a little more realistic, we're going to do some extra work.

Select the original “The” layer (not “The copy”) and click “Add a layer style.” (or double click “The” layer)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer6.png" alt="Layer6" width="320" height="500">

Go to “Stroke” in the Layer Style window, and set the following in order. “Size: 1~3px” (your preference) - “Position: Outside” - “Blend Mode: Normal” - “Opacity: 100%” - “Fill Type: Gradient” - “Gradient: Black and White” - “Style: Reflected, Align with Layer” - “Angle: 90 degree” - “Scale: 150%”
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer7.png" alt="Layer7" width="600" height="450">

Click “Bevel & Emboss” - “Style: Stroke Emboss” - “Technique: Chisel Hard” - “Depth: 170%” - “Direction: Up” - “Size: (greater than your font size)px or your preference” - “Angle: 120 degree” - Check “Use Global Light” - “Altitude: 30 degree” - “Gloss Contour: Ring Double, check Anti-aliased” - “Highlight Mode: Screen, White, Opacity 75%” - “Shadow Mode: Multiply, Black, Opacity 75%”
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer8.png" alt="Layer8" width="600" height="450">

Click “Outer Glow” - “Blend Mode: Screen” - “Opacity: 40%” - “Noise: 0%” - Select any grey color you want - “Technique: Softer” - “Spread: 0%” - “Size: (your font size)px.” Then, click OK.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ethan-J13/Ethan-Shik-Shey/gh-pages/assets/images/Shik_Images/Layer9.png" alt="Layer9" width="600" height="450">

Well done. We're done adding a shiny silver style to the text layer. Then, let’s add it to “Last” and “Samurai.” Don't you want to repeat the above process? We have a feature called "Copy Layer Style." Let's copy the styles applied to the “The” and “The copy” layers and paste them into “Last”, “Samurai” and “Last copy”, “Samurai copy.” In other words, copy the style of “The” layer and paste to “Last” and “Samurai”, and copy the style of “The copy” and paste to “Last copy” and “Samurai copy” layers.

Right-click on the layer with the style you want to copy and click "Copy Layer Style.”

Then, right-click on the layer you want to paste the style on and click "Paste Layer Style."

Nice job! You’ve done it! If you want to change the text size, you need to change the size of the original layer and the copy layer together. To select both layers, select one layer and hold down the Control key, and click another layer. And then changing the font size will apply to both layers. In the same way, you can change the position of the two layers at the same time, so please try it.

Done! As you can see the text has a shiny silver effect.
