# Effects

## Overview 

This section will elaborate and expand on the previous step and teach you how to use some more advanced techniques like the layer mask and one of photoshop's render options.
--------
Your image should currently look like this.

If it doesn't, try looking back at the previous steps and see what you may have missed.
--------
Click on the “Sword Fight” layer

Layer masks are used for non-destructive editing which means that the edits that you make to a layer mask can always be undone. This is unlike the eraser tool which is permanent once the file has been closed since this wipes the history.
While on the layer mask use a large, hardness 0%, black brush on the top of the sword fight image. This should make the edge rougher and make it blend in more smoothly

Make a new layer and call it “Light Glare”, move it to the top of the hierarchy.
 While on the layer you just created, use a white brush of size 500, hardness 0%, opacity 50%. Click once over the samurai in between his cheek and sword hand as shown in the image
