Your image should currently look like this. 

If it doesn't, try looking back at the previous steps and see what you may have missed.

Click on the “Sword Fight” layer
Create a layer mask by pressing this icon 

PICTURE. Layer masks are used for non-destructive editing which means that the edits that you make to a layer mask can always be undone. This is unlike the eraser tool which is permanent once the file has been closed since this wipes the history.
While on the layer mask use a large, hardness 0%, black brush on the top of the sword fight image. This should make the edge rougher and make it blend in more smoothly 
PICTURE.
Make a new layer and call it “Light Glare”, move it to the top of the hierarchy.
 While on the layer you just created, use a white brush of size 500, hardness 0%, opacity 50%. Click once over the samurai in between his cheek and sword hand as shown in the image 

PICTURE.
Change the layer opacity of the light glare layer to 63%.

Create a new layer and call it “Top Black”, move it to the top of the hierarchy.
While on the layer mask use a medium, hardness 0%, black brush on the top of the image 

PICTURE. 
 Create a new layer called “Lens Flare” and put it in between the “Light Glare” and “Top Black” layers.
Go to Edit > fill > black > ok 

PICTURE.
Change the blend mode on the layer to screen 

PICTURE.
Go to filter > render > lens flare > 100% brightness and 105mm then position the lens flare with your mouse as in the image.
