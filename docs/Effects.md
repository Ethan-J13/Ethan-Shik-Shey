# [](#header-1):sparkles: Layer Effects

This section will elaborate and expand on the previous step and teach you how to use some more advanced techniques like the layer mask and one of Photoshop's render options. 

Your image should currently look like this.

If it doesn't, try looking back at the previous step to see what you may have missed.

## [](#header-2)Layer Mask
1. _Click_ on the “Sword Fight” layer, then _click_ on the icon below the layers that looks like a rectangle with a circle in the middle. This will attach a layer mask onto the currently selected layer.

2. While on the layer mask use a large, hardness 0%, black **brush** on the top of the sword fight image. This should make the edge rougher and make it blend in more smoothly

## [](#header-2)Light Glare
1. _Create_ a new layer and call it “Light Glare”, move it to the top of the hierarchy.
2. _Click_ on the layer you just created and use a white **brush** of size 500, hardness 0%, opacity 50%. _Click_ once over the samurai in between his cheek and sword hand as shown in the image

3. **Change** the layer opacity of the light glare layer to 63%.

## [](#header-2)Vignette
1. _Create_ a new layer and call it “Top Black”, move it to the top of the hierarchy.
2. While on the layer mask use a size 500, opacity 100, hardness 0%, black **brush** and paint just off the top of the canvas, letting the edges of the brush spray paint the top of the image as shown in the image. This is called a vignette.

## [](#header-2)Lens Flare
1. _Create_ a new layer called “Lens Flare” and put it in between the “Light Glare” and “Top Black” layers.
2. Go to Edit > fill > black then press ok.

3. **Change** the blend mode on the layer to screen.

4. Go to filter > render > lens flare > 100% brightness and 105mm then position the lens flare by dragging it with your mouse as shown in the image, then press ok.

5. Press ctrl + t to resize the lens flare and to move it over the sword as shown in the image.

    Now that we have added some special effects onto the image we will move onto the next step: [Text Effects](https://ethan-j13.github.io/Ethan-Shik-Shey/docs/TextAndEffects/)
