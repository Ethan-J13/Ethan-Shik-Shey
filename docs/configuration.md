# :building_construction: Project Set-Up  

## Overview
<img align= "right" width ="150" style="padding-left: 20px;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161884126-5cbe8f3c-45b2-4843-a83e-3e3aa23abbc4.png">
<p style="padding-top: 20px;">
To understand the new menus, items, and options these instructions highlight, we will be creating the image shown to the right. As you will see, all the base images we used to create the end product have been modified in some way using PhotoShop. For this section, we will be going over the setup of the project. We will learn how to create a project with the correct pixel dimensions, adjust brightness in 2 different ways, and how to structure your layers.

## Starting the Project  
    
1. Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faK0iXuR9faH_1cJNtLx3uBfQIA4kwte?usp=sharing">these images<a> and navigate to where you saved them.  
    <br/>
2. *Right click* on the "building.png" file, hover over **Open With**, and select **Adobe PhotoShop 2022**  
    
    <br/>
    <img width="435" alt="building open with" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161665716-8cac88c3-1b42-421b-a773-46d924a2dfc3.png">  
    
    If PhotoShop does not show automatically, *click* on **Choose another app** and scroll down until PhotoShop appears. *Click* on it.

3. Rename the layer you just created to “Background”  

## Creating A Multiply layer  
    
1. Duplicate the "Multiply" layer  

2. Rename the duplicated layer to “Multiply”  

3. Select “Multiply” and *click* **Image** on the top bar.  
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161897158-f10c99df-b6d1-4f25-a418-d3e03311d381.gif">
    
4. Hover over **Adjustments** and select **Brightness and contrast**  

    This menu should appear:

    <img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161897476-f3413db5-7df4-4b79-af0e-b1c7448c6171.png">
    
    Turn the brightness to the max at 150. Close the menu.  
    

5. While still selected on the “Multiply” layer, **click** on the *blending mode* menu. Select *Multiply*.  
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161898705-c3ea9b95-2cb7-4619-8cc2-949dafe25979.png">  
  
    This menu is small and sometimes hard to see. It is located on the right-hand side, under the layer menu. The default item will be *Normal*.  

## Adding New Layers  
    
1. Drag in the Samurai.jpg image you downloaded earlier. Center this image, for our version, the points are X = 112, Y = -220.  
    
    If you are having trouble centering the image, you can manually input the values. While the Samurai image is selected, find the *transform* menu under *properties* on the right side. From here you can adjust the X/Y coordinates manually.  
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/162069170-ead54cd3-1d52-4556-b54c-102419589460.gif">
    
2. Drag in the SwordFight.jpg image you downloaded earlier. Set this photo at the bottom of the image. For our version, the points are X = 0, Y = 1572.
    
 
3. Set the opacity of the Sword Fight layer to 50%
    

## Making An Image more visible - Low opacity Highlighting
    
When we have lower opacity layers, we may find that they are not visible enough. Increasing the opacity back up may help in some scenarios, however, this defeats the purpose of lowering the opacity in the first place.  
    
To combat this, we can create backdrops using the paint tool.
    
1. Create a new layer, name it "Sword Fight Backdrop".  
    

2. Move this layer underneath the "Sword Fight" layer.  
    

3. While Selected on the "Sword Fight Backdrop" layer, select the brush tool. Set the size of the brush to 700 and the color to black.
    

4. Color the bottom where you placed the "Sword Fight" layer. Though we encourage the artist's touch here, we find that 3 passes of the brush is sufficient.  
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/162331657-09fdbb78-6a29-4b6f-b48e-9a00f027a341.gif">
    
## Making an Image more visible - Face Highlighting
    
When we have humans in a photo, highlighting their faces is a good way to pull attention toward them. Because this is not a low opacity layer, we cannot draw a backdrop like we did in the previous steps. Instead, we are going to cut out his face, then increase it's brightness.
    
1. **CTRL-Click** on the samurai layer where it's thumbnail is. This should select the Samurai.
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/162333003-e311a5f6-35ba-4a32-87a4-591c878db99b.png">
    
2. While holding *Alt* use the **lasso** tool to lasso out the samurai's body, leaving the head out.  
    
    Because we were holding *Alt* while lassoing, the selection made should be everything you did NOT lasso out. Your selection should now look like this:
    
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/162337917-79762541-cbaf-45a9-969b-e0df6f6d81ef.png">
    
3. Select the **Move** tool, *click* on the head while it is still lassoed, and copy/paste. This should give you cut-out of the samurai's face; Move it back so it fits on the body.
    

4. Name the layer you just created to "Samurai Face"
    
    
5. While selected on the "Samurai Face" layer, change it's brightness to 72 using the same steps we used to increase the "Multiply" layer's brightness.
