To understand the new menus, items, and options these instructions highlight, we will be creating the image shown to the right. As you will see, all the base images we used to create the end product have been modified in some way using PhotoShop. For this section, we will be going over the setup of the project. We will learn how to create a project with the correct pixel dimensions, adjust brightness in 2 different ways, and how to structure your layers.

1. Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faK0iXuR9faH_1cJNtLx3uBfQIA4kwte?usp=sharing">these images<a> and navigate to where you saved them.

    <br/>
    <img width="435" alt="building open with" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161665716-8cac88c3-1b42-421b-a773-46d924a2dfc3.png">  
    
    <table style="background-color: #90EE90;"><tr><td><img width="75" alt="info" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161668731-e3d68cca-1331-4054-97d2-f785d908dc2f.png"></td>
<td>If PhotoShop does not show automatically, <i>click</i> on <b>Choose another app</b> and scroll down until PhotoShop appears. <i>Click</i> on it.</td></tr></table><br />  
    
3. Rename the layer you just created to “Background”  
    
    &nbsp;
4. Duplicate this layer  
    
    &nbsp;
5. Rename the duplicated layer to “Multiply”  
    
    &nbsp;
6. Select “Multiply” and *click* **Image** on the top bar.  
    
    &nbsp;
7. Hover over **Adjustments** and select **Brightness and contrast**  
    &nbsp;
This menu should appear:  
    
  <table style="background-color: #90EE90;"><tr><td><img width="75" alt="info" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90651225/161668731-e3d68cca-1331-4054-97d2-f785d908dc2f.png">
</td><td>This menu allows you to set the brightness and contrast of a single layer.</td></tr></table>  
    Turn the brightness to the max at 150. Close the menu.  
    
8. While still selected on the “Multiply” layer, **click** on the *blending mode* menu.
INFO: This menu is small and sometimes hard to see. It is located on the right-hand side, under the layer menu. The default item will be *Normal*. 
9. Drag in the Samurai.jpg image you downloaded earlier. Center this image, for our version, the points are:
X = 112
Y = -220
INFO: If you are having trouble centering the image, you can manually input the values. While the Samurai image is selected, find the *transform* menu under *properties* on the right side. From here you can adjust the X/Y coordinates manually.
10. Drag in the SwordFight.jpg image you downloaded earlier. Set this photo at the bottom of the image
11. Set the opacity of the swordfight layer to 50%
12. Ensure your layers are correct, at this point your layers should look like this:
